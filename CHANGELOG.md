# Changelog

## UNRELEASED

Sitemaps now appear as XML source rather than awkwardly rendered text when viewed in the browser. There was never a problem with the XML from Google's perspective, but this improves the developer experience. Thanks to [norbie-nagy](https://github.com/norbie-nagy) for contributing this improvement.

## 1.0.1 - 2021-12-08

* Replaces the symlink in the tests with the `testModule` option.

## 1.0.0
